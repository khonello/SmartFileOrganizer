# Smart File Organizer

A desktop application that automatically organizes files into a logical, structured folder tree using **rule-based classification and metadata analysis**. No machine learning required — every organizational decision is deterministic, transparent, and traceable to an explicit rule.

## Overview

Smart File Organizer scans a chosen folder (or drive), classifies every file using extension checks, metadata, and pattern matching, and proposes a clean folder structure. Users **preview** every proposed change before anything is moved. Organization is non-destructive: on Apply, the folder's originals are staged into a `before/` subfolder and an organized copy is built in `after/`, so the two can be compared side by side. The originals are only removed when the user explicitly **commits**; a **rollback** restores the folder at any time.

The project intentionally avoids AI/ML in favor of a rule engine. This keeps behavior predictable, keeps the app fast and fully offline, and keeps the codebase easy to reason about, test, and defend academically.

---

## Core Objectives

- Automate tedious manual file organization
- Use deterministic rules and file metadata — not AI/ML — for classification
- Provide a clean, trustworthy UI with preview and undo
- Allow power users to define their own custom rules
- Keep the system fully offline with no external dependencies

---

## Features

### Phase 1 — Core Engine
- Recursive folder/drive scanning
- Classification by file extension and basic metadata
- Automatic folder structure generation
- Safe file movement (handles name collisions and duplicates)
- Preview mode showing before/after tree comparison

### Phase 2 — Smart Rules (Non-AI "smart" layer)
- Regex/pattern matching on filenames (dates, invoice numbers, project names, version numbers)
- Metadata extraction: EXIF (photos), PDF metadata (author/date), audio/video tags
- Keyword matching in filenames (plain string/pattern matching — no NLP)
- Grouping files by name similarity, date range, or size

### Phase 3 — Usability & Safety
- Undo/rollback via operation history log
- User-defined custom rules (JSON/YAML)
- Preset templates: Downloads cleanup, Photo organization, Work files
- Dry-run mode
- Progress tracking for large batches

---

## Classification Logic

Files are classified through a layered pipeline. Each layer can override the previous one, with **custom rules always taking highest priority**.

### 1. Extension-based (baseline)
| Category | Extensions |
|---|---|
| Documents | `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.txt`, `.xlsx` |
| Images | `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.svg` |
| Video | `.mp4`, `.avi`, `.mkv` |
| Audio | `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.flac` |
| Archives | `.zip`, `.rar`, `.7z` |
| Code | `.py`, `.js`, `.java`, `.cpp` |

### 2. Metadata-based
- Photos sorted by EXIF "date taken"
- Documents sorted by creation/modification date
- Optional size-based grouping (small / medium / large)

### 3. Pattern-based
| Input filename | Detected pattern | Destination |
|---|---|---|
| `Invoice_2026-01-26.pdf` | date + keyword | `2026/January/Invoices/` |
| `project_name_v1.2.docx` | project + version | `Projects/project_name/` |
| `Screenshot_2026-03-11.png` | screenshot prefix | `Screenshots/2026/` |

### 4. Custom rules (user-defined)
```json
{
  "rule": "contains_invoice",
  "pattern": "*invoice*",
  "destination": "Work/Invoices/{year}/{month}",
  "case_sensitive": false
}
```

**Rule precedence (highest to lowest):**
1. Custom user rules
2. Pattern-based rules
3. Metadata-based rules
4. Extension-based rules (fallback/default)

## Technical Architecture

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GUI | PySide6 | Desktop interface, drag-and-drop support (Windows) |
| File operations | `pathlib`, `shutil`, `os` | Scanning, moving, renaming |
| Metadata reading | `Pillow` (EXIF), `PyPDF2` (PDF), `mutagen` (audio/video) | Extracting file metadata |
| Pattern matching | `re`, `fnmatch` | Filename pattern detection |
| Date parsing | `datetime`, `dateutil` | Normalizing dates from filenames/metadata |
| Storage | SQLite | Operation history, undo log |
| Storage | JSON / YAML | User rules, presets, app settings |

No ML libraries, no model inference, no cloud APIs — everything runs locally and instantly.

### Module Breakdown

The project uses a **flat application layout** — modules live at the repo root
(no nested package), imported top-level (`from core.classifier import Classifier`).
Run with `python main.py`.

## System Design

### Processing Pipeline (before/after model)

Organization happens **in place, inside the selected folder**, via a
non-destructive before/after staging model:

```
┌──────────────┐   ┌─────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐   ┌────────────────┐
│ Space check   │─▶ │   Scanner    │─▶ │  Classifier  │─▶ │ Preview Builder │
│ (bail if full)│   │ (recursive)  │   │ (rule engine)│   │ (tree diff)     │
└──────────────┘   └─────────────┘   └──────────────┘   └────────────────┘
                                                                  │
                                                                  ▼

                                                                  │  approve
                                                                  ▼

                          │  (SQLite)    │           │  move originals → before/   │
                          └──────────────┘           │  copy organized → after/    │
                                                      └────────────────────────────┘
                                                                  │
                                            ┌─────────────────────┴─────────────────────┐
                                            ▼                                             ▼
                            ┌────────────────────────────┐          ┌────────────────────────────┐
                            │  Commit ("discard old")     │          │  Rollback / Cancel          │
                            │  delete before/,            │          │  delete after/,             │
                            │  offload after/ → root      │          │  restore before/ → root     │
                            └────────────────────────────┘          └────────────────────────────┘
```

### Safety Principles
- **Check disk space first.** Because `before/` (the moved originals) and `after/` (the organized copy) coexist during review, Apply is refused up front if the copy won't fit — a run never starts unless it can finish. Only the `after/` copy costs space; moving originals into `before/` is a same-volume rename.
- **Nothing is destructive until you commit.** Apply only *stages* (originals move into `before/`, an organized copy is built in `after/`); the originals aren't deleted until you explicitly **commit** ("discard old directory"). **Rollback** at any point restores the folder exactly.
- **Nothing moves without preview approval.** The classifier only produces a proposed plan; Apply is a separate, explicit step, and Commit is a third.
- **Every copy is logged** with source path, destination path, and timestamp *before* it's performed, enabling recovery even if the app crashes mid-batch.
- **Collision handling**: if a destination file already exists, the app appends a suffix (`file (1).pdf`) rather than overwriting, unless the user opts into overwrite mode.
- **Dry-run mode**: runs the full pipeline and shows the resulting plan without touching the filesystem.

## Data Model

### Operation History (SQLite)

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | INTEGER PK | Unique operation ID |
| `batch_id` | TEXT | Groups operations from the same run (for batch undo) |
| `source_path` | TEXT | Original file location |
| `destination_path` | TEXT | New file location |
| `operation_type` | TEXT | `copy` (Apply, default) / `move` (used when discarding) / `rename` |
| `timestamp` | DATETIME | When the operation was executed |
| `undone` | BOOLEAN | Whether this operation has been rolled back |

### Rule Definition (JSON)

```json
{
  "rule": "string (unique identifier)",
  "pattern": "string (glob or regex)",
  "match_type": "filename | extension | metadata",
  "destination": "string (template with {year}/{month}/{project} etc.)",
  "case_sensitive": "boolean",
  "priority": "integer (higher = evaluated first)"
}
```

---

## User Workflow

1. **Select folder** to organize
2. **Choose a preset strategy** (Downloads, Photos, Work Files) or define custom rules
3. App runs a **disk-space check**, then **scans** files and applies the rule pipeline
4. User **previews** the proposed tree structure with file counts
5. User can **adjust** individual files or tweak rules before applying
6. **Apply** — originals are staged into `before/`, an organized copy is built in `after/` (real-time progress bar)
7. **Review** `before/` vs `after/`, then either **Commit** (discard originals, offload `after/` into the folder) or **Rollback** (restore the original folder)

## Configuration

User rules and presets live in `config/rules/*.json`. Example custom rule file:

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "rule": "invoice_detection",
      "pattern": "*invoice*",
      "match_type": "filename",
      "destination": "Work/Invoices/{year}/{month}",
      "case_sensitive": false,
      "priority": 10
    },
    {
      "rule": "screenshot_detection",
      "pattern": "Screenshot_*",
      "match_type": "filename",
      "destination": "Screenshots/{year}",
      "case_sensitive": false,
      "priority": 8
    }
  ]
}
```

App-level settings (`config/settings.json`):
```json
{
  "default_preset": "downloads_cleanup",
  "collision_strategy": "append_suffix",
  "dry_run_default": true,
  "history_retention_days": 30
}
```

## Design Rationale

**Why rule-based instead of AI/ML?**
- **Deterministic & debuggable** — every classification decision traces back to a specific rule, which matters for both user trust and academic defensibility.
- **Fast and fully offline** — no model inference latency, no GPU requirement, no API costs or network dependency.
- **Simpler scope for a semester project** — avoids the risk of AI integration eating the whole timeline while still leaving room to demonstrate strong engineering: system design, safe file I/O, rule engine architecture, and UX around preview/undo.
- **Easier to test** — rule-based logic has clear, enumerable test cases; ML classification would require labeled datasets and probabilistic evaluation.

**Why preview-before-apply?**
File organization tools that silently move files erode user trust. Separating "planning" from "execution" as distinct pipeline stages makes the system safer and makes the undo log meaningful (every executed operation was explicitly approved).

---

## Future Work

Potential extensions beyond the current scope, not required for the core deliverable:

- Optional lightweight AI layer (e.g., simple text/image classification) as a stretch goal if time permits
- Cloud storage integration (Google Drive, Dropbox)
- Scheduled/automatic organization via filesystem watching (`watchdog`)
- Cross-device sync of rules and presets
- Reinforcement-style feedback loop that adjusts rule priority based on user corrections
